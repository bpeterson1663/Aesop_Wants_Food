#Aesop Wants Food

This was an assignment I had at Prime Digital Academy. 
This was a group project I worked on with two other developers in which we were to create a project that Prime's mascot (Aesop, who was the founders dog) would make a request for a certain type of food and the user would have to select that food to feed him. 
This was one of our first projects setting up our own server using Node.js and Express.js. We also learned more about AJAX to make requests to the server. 

##Instructions
To test out the project, feel free to fork it or download a copy. In the command line of the root directory type in "npm start" to start the server. 
Then in the browser type in "localhost:5000" to run.
